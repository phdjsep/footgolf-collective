      <description>Origin story Basketball, soccer, and football all are sports with uniforms, right?
FootGolf is not a bit different. The only thing is you get to customize the jersey you wear, however you&amp;rsquo;d like. Instead of your coach forcing you to pick between #98 or #89 because they are the only two left in the gym closet.
We call it the &amp;ldquo;dress code&amp;rdquo; but to be quite frank, it is no different than a personalized uniform.</description>
