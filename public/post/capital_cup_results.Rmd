Another Major, another analysis...

This time I didn't have the pleasure of being there, but it was fun to keep up from afar. I've pulled data and calculated the course statistics for the tournament. <!--more-->


## Overall Stats

Some interesting patterns emerge when calculating all the scores across all rounds.

- Holes 3, 7, 12, and 14 were the most difficult. Three of them were par 3's and one par 4.
- Hole 6, 8, 10 were the easiest. All par 5's. :thinking:


```{r}
scores %>% 
          group_by(hole, par, yds) %>% 
          summarize(avg.score = format(round(mean(strokes), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                    better = sum(score < -2), 
                    eagles = sum(score == -2), 
                    birdies = sum(score == -1), 
                    pars = sum(score == 0), 
                    bogeys = sum(score == 1), 
                    doubles = sum(score == 2), 
                    worse = sum(score > 2), 
                    par.avg = cell_spec(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                                        color = ifelse(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3) > 0, "red", "green"))) %>%
    kable(escape = F, format = 'html') %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```


## Per Round

### Round 1
```{r}
scores %>% 
    filter(round == 1) %>%
          group_by(hole, par, yds) %>% 
          summarize(avg.score = format(round(mean(strokes), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                    better = sum(score < -2), 
                    eagles = sum(score == -2), 
                    birdies = sum(score == -1), 
                    pars = sum(score == 0), 
                    bogeys = sum(score == 1), 
                    doubles = sum(score == 2), 
                    worse = sum(score > 2), 
                    par.avg = cell_spec(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                                        color = ifelse(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3) > 0, "red", "green"))) %>%
    kable(escape = F, format = 'html') %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

### Round 2
```{r}
scores %>% 
    filter(round == 2) %>%
          group_by(hole, par, yds) %>% 
          summarize(avg.score = format(round(mean(strokes), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                    better = sum(score < -2), 
                    eagles = sum(score == -2), 
                    birdies = sum(score == -1), 
                    pars = sum(score == 0), 
                    bogeys = sum(score == 1), 
                    doubles = sum(score == 2), 
                    worse = sum(score > 2), 
                    par.avg = cell_spec(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                                        color = ifelse(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3) > 0, "red", "green"))) %>%
    kable(escape = F, format = 'html') %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

### Round 3
```{r}
scores %>% 
    filter(round == 3) %>%
          group_by(hole, par, yds) %>% 
          summarize(avg.score = format(round(mean(strokes), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                    better = sum(score < -2), 
                    eagles = sum(score == -2), 
                    birdies = sum(score == -1), 
                    pars = sum(score == 0), 
                    bogeys = sum(score == 1), 
                    doubles = sum(score == 2), 
                    worse = sum(score > 2), 
                    par.avg = cell_spec(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3), 
                                        color = ifelse(format(round(mean(score), 3), nsmall = 3) > 0, "red", "green"))) %>%
    kable(escape = F, format = 'html') %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

When we look at the scoring distribution across the rounds they all seem to be quite normally distributed around par. Interestingly round 2 was more difficult for some and easier for others as indicated by the larger bars for "better than par" and "worse than par".

```{r}
ggplot(scores, aes(factor(score))) + 
    geom_bar() +
    facet_grid(. ~ round) +
    labs(x = "Score to Par", y = "Count") +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Scores by Round")


ggplot(scores, aes(factor(score), fill=factor(score))) + 
    geom_bar() +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size=6)) +
    facet_grid(round ~ hole) +
    labs(x = "Score to Par", y = "Count") +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Scores by Hole by Round") + 
    theme(legend.position="bottom", legend.direction="horizontal") + 
    guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Score to Par"))


ggplot(scores, aes(x=factor(hole), y=factor(score))) + 
    geom_count(aes(color=score)) + 
    scale_size_area() + 
    scale_color_gradient(low = '#639D66', high = '#F33E2E') + 
    facet_grid(. ~ round) + 
    labs(x = "Hole #", y = "Score to Par") +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Scores by Hole by Round") + 
    theme(legend.position="bottom", legend.direction="horizontal")
```
