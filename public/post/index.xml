      <description>Origin story Basketball, soccer, and football all are sports with uniforms, right?
FootGolf is not a bit different. The only thing is you get to customize the jersey you wear, however you&amp;rsquo;d like. Instead of your coach forcing you to pick between #98 or #89 because they are the only two left in the gym closet.
We call it the &amp;ldquo;dress code&amp;rdquo; but to be quite frank, it is no different than a personalized uniform.</description>

      <description>Origin story There is nothing else more pleasurable than waking up the morning of competition day in a dreamy hotel. Nerves get the best of you&amp;hellip;or maybe it?s just the coffee. You have to sprint toward the loo. In your zen, 18 back to back eagles sink and all the podium glory is owed to you.
West Coast FootGolf Club (WC) knows a little thing or two about back to back?</description>
