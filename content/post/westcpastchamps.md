## Origin story
There is nothing else more pleasurable than waking up the morning of competition day in a dreamy hotel. Nerves get the best of you...or maybe it?s just the coffee. You have to sprint toward the loo. In your zen, 18 back to back eagles sink and all the podium glory is owed to you.

West Coast FootGolf Club (WC) knows a little thing or two about back to back? not eagles per say (well not 18 straight, although I wouldn't put it past these guys) but 2015, 2016, and now the 2018 Club National Champions!

The National Championship was played at the ever so gorgeous Reunion Resort down in Kissimmee, Florida late this August. Playing host to a number of top players in the world, including Matias Perrone (ARG, Placing 4th) and Nicolas Garcia (ARG, Placing 7th), Oakland Footgolf Club member and 2018 National Champion: Cesar Chavez

Three of the top 6 players at this years event are members of West Coast FootGolf Club. Respectively; Nick Wallace, Jordan Godfrey, and Sharif Khatib. This qualifies them to make up part of the 2019 Jansen Cup team (USA vs. UK 2019). Where USA will travel to Celtic Manor Resort and look to avenge their loss to team UK in the first edition ever played. This makes Jordan and Nick selections for TEAM USA, both returning to represent the country once again in December! Sharif makes team USA by placing 3rd in the tour rankings.

Other members joining team USA from West Coast FG are Ramzey Khatib, Jeremy Johnson, Ken Fleck, and Leilani Tedeski.  

Last year Oakland FootGolf Club defeated Miami FootGolf Club led by the Piero Menor and Mariano Copello, the Footgolfos.

This year West Coast came fierce and fueled by the desire to win it all after missing out on the finals the previous year. Oakland looking to become repeat champions, met with WC to battle it out to be number one.

West Coast was able to achieve victory 6-2 to become victors of the title 3 out of the first 4 seasons. What an incredible accomplishment for the group of all-star players. What?s going on over there? Must be the water?or the training?you decide.

To be honest though, who are these guys? 

West Coasts FootGolf Clubs 2018 Roster:

Sharif Khatib              Ramzey Khatib                 Jose Acevedo          Adam Ortiz
Jorge Vazquez           Michael Gora                    Leilani Tedeski         Jo Reid
Jeremy Johnson        Adrian Moreno                  Nick wallace            Ken Fleck
Joey Miller                  Robert Cohmanschi        Jordan Godfrey

All of these names are easily recognizable throughout the FootGolf Community. Ladies and gentlemen, these footgolfers have been amongst the top of nearly every leaderboard in AFGL tour tournaments this year. No wonder they are three time champions!

I asked Jordan (United States #1 ranked player of 2018) a little about his play, the game, and of course how it was to win the club title once again. He practices at multiple courses throughout California in order to stay in top condition and peak performance. With a soccer background and interest in recreational golf, Jordan stated ?I simply got hooked four years ago? and decided I wanted to compete as much as I could.?. That?s exactly what he has done, and has done so with great success. 

Who are some of the people, whether it be FootGolf or traditional golf, that you look up to? 
 ?I love watching golf on the weekends and learning as much as I can about their game because it translates to our game. I have so much respect for the professionalism and etiquette on display by the players on tour. I want that to be applied to FootGolf and for it to also became another gentlemen?s game.?

I?m pretty positive Jordan and the rest of West Coast FootGolf Club plan to return and uphold the Club title in 2019. As of his feelings after winning the 2018 title? ??such an  amazing experience. It is what we work towards all year. That is always the number one priority on our list of goals as a club.? Tacking on ?...this years (win) was even more meaningful after what unfolded last year and it was a special performance from the guys against our heated rivals Oakland FootGolf.?

West Coast FootGolf is the club to beat everyone!
Will you be the club to knock them from the pedestal in 2019?
Maybe?get out and train!! 
I bet Jordan is.
