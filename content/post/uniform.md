## Origin story
Basketball, soccer, and football all are sports with uniforms, right?

FootGolf is not a bit different. The only thing is you get to customize the jersey you wear, however you'd like. Instead of your coach forcing you to pick between #98 or #89 because they are the only two left in the gym closet.

We call it the "dress code" but to be quite frank, it is no different than a personalized uniform.

A shirt with a collar on it is the "Jersey". You can customize it to any design that is appropriate in manner and may have your name and/or clubs name on it.

Shorts are a great idea. Pants would be hard to kick in. I think back to days of running in the fields as a kid with jeans on... nope. Golf shorts are great to wear, they provide enough flexibility and comfortable to kick in. Especially in tournaments, do not show up wearing gym shorts... or at least change them before kick off.

Footwear is not allowed to have any spikes, or cleat! Turf, indoor, and running shoes/ trainers are the only allowed and approved footwear.
The golf course will not allow you to play with cleats at all.

Socks have to be knee high, argyle style is the "in" style but not required.

All in all, courses want you to play there and have a great time. Some need FootGolf to help with funds to provide a great course. Turning away traditional golfers is not what a course wants.

Please, follow the uniform and have a great time kicking!
