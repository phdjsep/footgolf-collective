## Origin story
It's the night before tournament day, bags are being double and triple checked to make sure nothing is forgotten. In no particular order, I've came up with a list of 5 things you may not want to forget to throw in your bag before heading out to the course on tournament day.

5. Ball Marker
A custom poker chip, golf marker, or quarter can be used to mark your ball which must be done when it stops on the green. If you have forgotten yours, check the pro shop. Almost every golf course makes them available for purchase at a very cheap price. Worst case, speed over to your local 99 cent store and grab a cheap poker set.

4. Change of socks and/or shoes
An average 18 holes of footgolf with friends can last up to 2 hours, and that's a bit long. On tournament days, you can double that time. Competition is fierce and people want to win. More players, more concentration, more thinking about each shot. It slows the pace a little. Sometimes tournament can start early in the morning or run late into the evening and dew can make for some very wet and uncomfortable footwear. A change in socks and shoes in between holes after the sun comes up, may make the world of difference.

3. Ball pump and needle
I swear I pumped my ball up before leaving my home in pennsylvania driving down to baltimore for a tournament. I pull it out at our first tee off and it was quite flat. I was also certain had brought my pump with me? I did not. Neither did the three others in my foursome. I had to play three holes with a flat ball before finding someone with a pump? Bring it! You may be saving your booty, or someone else's!

2. Snacks
I get hangry. You get hangry. What is hangry? You get extra mad when you are hungry. Bring some nuts, crackers, an apple, anything you can snack on and keep up your energy. Some tournament rounds can last 4 hours, and if you ate 4 hours before the tournament even started? You may get that little feeling I described earlier. 

1. Course Notes
If you have the opportunity to take a practice round, take a notepad and pen. I Couldn't tell you how many times I see some guys all shoot one way off the tee and one guy boots the opposite and is the only one to eagle. Take good notes and take your time on practice day. On tournament day, trust you took good notes and follow them.

What are some items you never forget to put in your bag whether it be for a round with friends or to take on the competition? Let us know in the comments!
